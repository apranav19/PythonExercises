PythonExercises
===============

Ever since I learnt about Exercism.io, I have been working on their Python coding exercises. They are relatively simple problems, but it's a great way to learn Python.

Each exercise is represented by a folder of it's own. Any files with the word 'test' in the filename has been created by Exercism.io.

These files are for learning purposes only.

Finally, a big thank you to the creator of Exercism.io, Katrina Owen.
