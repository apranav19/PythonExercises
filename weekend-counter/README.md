This exercise is a bit different. It was created by CheckIO (http://checkio.org)

Here, I tried to use Functional Programming to make my code more succint.

Here's the problem description:

Sofia has given you a schedule and two dates and told you she needs help planning her weekends. She has asked you to count each day of rest (Saturday and Sunday) starting from the initial date to final date. You should count the initial and final dates if they fall on a Saturday or Sunday.

The dates are given as datetime.date (Read about this module here). The result is an integer.

Input: Two dates -- from and to inclusive (datetime.date).
Output: An integer.
